        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I&apos;ve been coding for six years. I started with 
            Python in my freshman year of high school, and 
            I&apos;ve been coding ever since. In my junior year 
            of high school, I took a game design course, 
            which sparked my interest in the subject. 
            Currently, I&apos;m in my junior year at Texas A&M, 
            majoring in computer science.</p>
