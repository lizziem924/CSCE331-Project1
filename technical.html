        <p>Egyptian Rat Slap is a multiplayer card game where 
            the goal for a player is to gain the entire deck. 
            The deck is split evenly, and players take turns 
            placing cards in the center. There are various ways 
            to gain cards, which can be split into two categories, 
            luck based and skill based.
