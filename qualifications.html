        <p>Game design is one of my interests in computer science.
            My first experience with coding truly complex and 
            interesting programs was in a game design class I 
            took in high school. This is the class that 
            encouraged me to major in computer science. 
            It opened my eyes to just how much time and effort 
            a video game takes to create, which made me have 
            a greater appreciation not just for video games, 
            but all of the other pieces of software around me.</p>
