        <h2>My Service</h2>
        <p>I am an Eagle Scout, which is the highest rank that 
            can be awarded in the Boy Scouts of America. For my 
            Eagle service project, I organized a food drive for 
            a nonprofit called Mission Oak Cliff. Mission Oak 
            Cliff offers various services, like providing food 
            and clothing, to those living in Dallas who are in 
            need. The first step of this project was to create 
            leaflets that explained who I was, what my project 
            was about, and when and where to leave donations. 
            Next, I gathered some volunteers and we went around 
            my neighborhood and distributed around 200 of the 
            aforementioned leaflets encouraging people to leave 
            food donations on their porches for me to pick up 
            the next week. The next week, my volunteers and I 
            drove around and picked up the donations. I received 
            hundreds of food items and a monetary donation of 
            $100, of which I spent at the grocery store, 
            purchasing items like ready-to-eat food that the 
            charity requested. In the end, I donated over 500 
            food items to Mission Oak Cliff.</p>
